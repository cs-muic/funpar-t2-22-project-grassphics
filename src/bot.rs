/** MINIMAX CODE NOTES
 * Objective: 
 *      > Design in such a way that it handles AB in parallel easier
 * Questions: 
 *      > DFS/BFS-esque design might be better in multithreading 
 *      > Any possible ways to handle generating new board from previous
 *        (multiple reads at the same time?) such that there is less operation 
 *        need to be done.
 * 
 * Current Design: 
 *      > The maximum depth of pre calculated move is 5
 *      > At depth 1-3, the moves will be separated in parallel
 *        if there is only 1 possibility, the move will be done in sequential
 *      > At depth 4-5, the moves will be calculated in sequential unless if 
 *        there are >= 16 moves where each thread calculated 8 moves each.
